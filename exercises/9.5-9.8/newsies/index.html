                    <p style="display: inline-block; width: 30%"> locals of <span>Modesto, California</span> gathered again today for the <u>30th anual ninja parade</u>.</p>
                    <p style="display: inline-block; width: 30%"> as people lined the streets eagerly waiting, it would appear to many that nothing was occuring in the town, and a strange silence seemed to hang over as there was a wait for nothing.</p>
                    <p style="display: inline-block; width: 30%"> however, an hour later, as people started to pack up their things and head home, seeming please with the previous events, they started to discover many things out of place, <i>"I just found a piece of candy in my pocket."</i> said one little boy on his way home.</p>
